## Scenario
Here I am considering the online education application for lecture delivering. Indeed it is one of the best application to attend meetings. The teacher can share their screen with students to make them understand the lecture, show them slides and give them tasks to review their concept. Teachers and students need a good and effectve interface for interaction and which is easy to use. For this, I have developed an online education application in which a user will perform certain tasks and activites to make the environment just like the actual classroom.

## Tasks involved in an online lecture delivery
There are multiple tasks being held during online lecture delivery. Teachers present slides for better understanding. They open their mics for better interaction with students. Teachers can record their lecture and share it with students. Students can attend quizez and vivas easily. Teachers assign them work from home and check it online. Students who donâ€™t want to open their mic are using chat box to communicate.  Moreover, there is an attendance system using face recognition of students by using AI algorithm. Also, it will detect the facial expressions of the user while taking the lecture to let the teacher know either the student is attentive, sleepy or enjoying.

 ## Gulf of execution and evaluation
The gulf of execution and evaluation in online lecture delivery app is that mic is glitching, camera gets hung up, voice is not clear. It shows spinning wheel of loading while user performs an action. To fulfill this gap, I have developed an online education app which will focuses on the ease of its user, provides the best and effective interface, provides emojis for reactions, provied responsive chat box, an atendance system by facial recognition of students and is secure.
