###Task 1:###
Here I am considering the zoom online application for lecture delivering. Indeed it is one of the best application to attend meetings. The teacher can share their screen with students to make them understand the lecture, show them slides and give them tasks to review their concept. Moreover, the teacher can record their lectures and can upload it so that students who are unclear can understand better. 

###Task 2:###
There are multiple tasks being held during lecture delivery. Teachers present slides for better understanding. They open their mics for better interaction with students. Teachers can record their lecture and share it with students. Students can attend quizez and vivas easily. Teachers assign them work from home and check it online. Students who don’t want to open their mic are using chat box to communicate.




###Task 3: ###
Persona of A Teacher.
There is an aged teacher in my university and she has done Masters in computer science. Her age is 56 and she is married. She has 4 kids. She is very calm and sweet but gets frustrated at times due to a lot of work and busy schedule. She has a fine personality and her teaching skills are enthusiastic. She wakes up early in the morning, drops her kids at school first and reaches school on time. She has always been punctual and her communication skills are great too.

The gulf of execution and evaluation in online education app is that mic is glitching, camera gets hung up, voice is not clear. It shows spinning wheel of loading while user performs an action.
